# Home Affordability Analysis Tool for North Carolina (Early Project)

This is one of my early project. The intent of this project was to learn how to use more advanced feature of Tableau and combine data from multiple sources. In this project I pulled raw home price data for North Carolina as well as U.S. Deparment of Defense Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Data. The end product shows the average home price by zip code and the BAH rate using an interactive map. When the cursor is used to hover over a specific zip, the estimate monthly payment is also displayed.
