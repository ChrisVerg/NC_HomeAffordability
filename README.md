# Home Affordability Analysis Tool for North Carolina (Early Project)

This is one of my early projects. This tool shows home prices and estimated payments in a format which a junior enlisted Service Member can compare their allowance to the cost of the selected area. The intent of this project was to learn how to use more advanced features of Tableau and combine data from multiple sources. In this project I pulled raw home price data for North Carolina as well as U.S. Deparment of Defense Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Data. The end product shows the average home price by zip code and the BAH rate using an interactive map. When hovering the your cursor over a specific zip, the estimate monthly payment is also displayed. 

### Please click [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/NCPriceBAHDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_linkb) to view the Tableau map. 

At the top left of the map you will find two drop down menus to select the city and rank/dependent status for the BAH rate. On the right, you can select the metro area and see the average home price and estimate payment by zip code.
